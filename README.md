Made this badboy in a few hours, lots of fun and plenty more to go with it! Challenge - make array not n by n but
more of a random array length and have multiple words hidden in word search provided by user.

### wordsearcher.js 
To run: requires both wordsearcher.js, and wordsearcher.html saved to the same directory. 

User Interface to generate random table to which user inserts a word either forwards, reversed, diagonally reversed, 
and the program runs a brute-force word search algorithm on array representing table. Note that one could code this
without an algorithm as you could just track the inputs changed by user but I thought it would be a lot more fun to 
code the algorithm as well! But I get it, sometimes you just feel like doing the easier stuff.
